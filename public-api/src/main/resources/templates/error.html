	   		<p>`I refuse to prove that I exist,´ says Page, `for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.´</p> 
			<p>`But,´ says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.´</p>
			<p>`Oh dear,´ says Page, `I hadn't thought of that,´ and promptly disappears in a puff of logic.</p>
